# 🚀 Real-Time Todo Setup Guide

Your TaskVault Pro is now powered by Supabase for real-time functionality! Here's how to set it up:

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Supabase project already configured
- ✅ Environment variables set up
- ✅ Authentication working

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### 1. Run the SQL Script

Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor** and run the `supabase_tasks_table.sql` script:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content from supabase_tasks_table.sql
```

This will create:
- `tasks` table with proper structure
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Real-time subscriptions enabled
- Performance indexes
- Automatic timestamp updates

### 2. Verify Table Creation

Check **Table Editor** → **tasks** to ensure the table was created with:
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users)
- `title` (Text, Required)
- `description` (Text, Optional)
- `priority` (Text: low/medium/high)
- `status` (Text: pending/in-progress/completed)
- `done` (Boolean)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)
- `updated_at` (Timestamp)

## 🔐 Security Features

The table includes Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
- Users can only see their own tasks
- Users can only modify their own tasks
- Automatic user isolation

## ⚡ Real-Time Features

### What Works in Real-Time:
- ✅ **Task Creation** - New tasks appear instantly for all connected users
- ✅ **Task Updates** - Changes sync across all devices in real-time
- ✅ **Task Deletion** - Removed tasks disappear instantly
- ✅ **Status Changes** - Priority, status, and completion updates sync live
- ✅ **Multi-Device Sync** - Open the app on multiple devices to see real-time updates

### Connection Status Indicator:
- 🟢 **Green** - Connected and syncing
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Connecting (pulsing animation)
- 🔴 **Red** - Connection error or timeout

## 🧪 Testing Real-Time

1. **Open Multiple Tabs/Devices**
   - Open TaskVault Pro in 2+ browser tabs
   - Or use different devices/browsers

2. **Test Real-Time Updates**
   - Add a task in one tab → See it appear instantly in others
   - Mark a task complete → See the change sync across all tabs
   - Edit a task → See updates in real-time
   - Delete a task → See it disappear everywhere

3. **Check Connection Status**
   - Look for the status indicator in the top-right
   - Should show "CONNECTED" when working properly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Real-Time Not Working?
1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to Database → Replication
   - Ensure "tasks" table is enabled for real-time

2. **Verify RLS Policies**
   - Check Database → Policies
   - Ensure all 4 policies are active

3. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open browser DevTools → Console
   - Look for subscription status messages

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set

### Common Issues:
- **"No tasks showing"** → Check if user is authenticated
- **"Can't add tasks"** → Verify RLS policies are active
- **"Real-time not syncing"** → Check Supabase Replication settings
